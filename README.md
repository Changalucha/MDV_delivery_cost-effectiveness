# About
This repository contains the analytical workflow for the cost-effectiveness evaluation of community-led versus team-led mass dog vaccination (MDV) strategies in Tanzania. Rabies causes approximately 60,000 human deaths annually in low- and middle-income countries, where domestic dogs remain the primary vector. Mass dog vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention for rabies elimination, yet identifying economically feasible delivery strategies remains challenging in resource-limited settings.

# Methods 
The analyses evaluate data from a three-year randomized controlled trial (2020-2023) across 110 wards in northern Tanzania, comparing standard team-led annual vaccination campaigns against a community-led hybrid approach utilizing thermotolerant vaccines with year-round delivery.
Using ward-level cost and vaccination data, we assess cost-effectiveness from both provider and societal perspectives. Key outcomes include total programme costs, cost per dog vaccinated, marginal costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Statistical analyses employ mixed-effects regression models to account for ward-level clustering, with bootstrap methods for ICER confidence intervals. Cost comparisons use both parametric and non-parametric tests to handle skewed distributions, stratified by rural/urban setting, district, delivery method, and time period.
All analyses were conducted in R, and this repository includes data processing scripts, cost aggregation functions, statistical modeling code, and reproducible workflows used to generate the results, tables, and figures presented in the manuscript.
